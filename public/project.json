This design serves our purpose to get their contact any time they may seek further help or assistance. Putting form button into menu is also a great visual representation. It basically informs our users about our form within a second after entering the website. For summary, 87% of main pages currently contain secondary way to reach contact form, and that is by displaying it directly, and as mentioned, 100% of pages contain at least one way to reach contact form thru the button in the menu.",

We also wanted to reach this goal by developing a structure of the website that would get them to About us page or to one of our success stories pages as fast as possible.
