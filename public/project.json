        "solution": "After our agreenment on collaboration, we took a step back and started right from the scratch rather then continuing with original logic of the app. The discovery phase was all about explaining me their business idea, analysing current competitors and their design solutions and its problems. After that, we came up with interviewing potential users and started prototyping phase enriched with series of A/B tests and user tests.

Therefore I had to go thru whole process once again and simplify some features to fulfill their wish and then run one more test session where I tested if users can still navigate themselves thru the app.",

Users were never interrupted and after finishing of all tasks, interview was held to gain some feedback about their experience. User interviews also continued later in the process after every usability test that has been done and the feedback from each interview has been used as a valid point for next design round.

Thanks to this functionality we discovered some weak spots earlier in the process. During final usability test all test subjects passed all tasks without any major issues and in parts that were already in original testing they performed even faster than in first test session and described new design solution as simplified and easy to understand.",

Besides this, no bigger problems have been occurred along the way and our final goals has been fulfilled maybe even beyond expected level, before project closure. I had a session with Winding Tree where I presented them all my findings and gave them some relevant feedback that I have collected from the users including UX and also other areas."

So, we sketched a solution where most pages lead to it in two possible ways, the first essential way is thru the button in the menu, and secondary way is usually by form being directly placed on the end of various pages. This design serves our purpose to get their contact any time they may seek further help or assistance. Putting form button into menu is also a great visual representation. It basically informs our users about our form within a second after entering the website. For summary, 87% of main pages currently contain secondary way to reach contact form, and that is by displaying it directly, and as mentioned, 100% of pages contain at least one way to reach contact form thru the button in the menu.",
